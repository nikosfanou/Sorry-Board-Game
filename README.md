How to run the game:

The game just started:
All are ready and initialized. The first card has been dropped.
Turn is given randomly. InfoBox informs you about who is going to
play first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to begin from start:
Only with cards 1,2 and occasionally with Sorry card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to move a pawn:
Click on the pawn you want to move. The pawn will move accordinly
to the card if the move is valid. If the number of the card is 1,2,
3,5,8 or 12 the pawn moves front by number. If the card is 4 the
pawn moves back by 4. If the card is 7 you can move both of your
pawns 7 in total. If the card is 10 you can either move front by 10
or move back 1 square. If the card is 11 you can either move front
by 11 or exchange the pawn with an opponent pawn. If the card is Sorry
Card you can only move your pawn if it is located in its start square
and if at least one of opponent's pawns is located on a simple or slide 
square. If you use this card you send your pawn where the opponent pawn 
is and then you send the opponent pawn to its start square. 
With cards 7,10,11 and Sorry you select your move from a java dialog.
When a pawn moves to a start slide square of different colour, slides to
the end slide square and sends every pawn which is located in this slide
to its home. Also, if a pawn moves to a square where a pawn of a different
colour is located it sends the opponent pawn to its start square.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a move isn't valid:
A pawn can't move to a square where a pawn of the same colour is located.
Also, in order to move to its home square it needs to move the accurate 
number of squares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you can fold:
You can fold only when all the available moves are not valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to win:
All your pawns must reach the finish line which is their home square.
